\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Slope of Linearized Position Graph}
The kinematics equation most suited to being linearized to use to find accerelation is as follows:
\[\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\]
Since our starting point was defined as our zero point and initial velocity $v_0$ was close to zero, the equation can be rewritten as a position function of time $t$ as follow:
\[x(t) = \frac{1}{2}at^2\]

\subsection{Possible Improvements to Lab}
If we were to redo our lab to improve our results, there would be a few improvements we would make to our methodology to achieve that goal. Firstly, we would strive for more consistency in the release of the cart on the ramp. A few times, our cart was a little farther behind the photogate than we would've hoped for, meaning the cart did have slight velocity when passing through it. There were also some instances where a little force was applied to the cart, also slightly increasing its starting velocity, so reducing that would also be a goal if this lab were to be repeated. Collecting more data points per distance would also be helpful in increasing the accuracy of our acceleration values.
